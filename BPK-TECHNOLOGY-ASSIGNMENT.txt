â€¢ For a school, I would like to store the marks for all the students of grade 1 to 8 for all the subjects they study.

o Design a table structure to store the student marks in all subjects

create table SubjectMarks (
    SubjectMarkID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentID INT,
    SubjectID INT,
    Mark INT,
    foreign key (StudentID) references Students(StudentID),
    foreign key (SubjectID) references Subjects(SubjectID)
);

o Design a screen to add new student details (f.name, l.name, dob, parent's name, address, city, phone#) and show the list of students with these data in a table as and when it is created.

create table Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    DOB DATE,
    ParentsName VARCHAR(100),
    Address VARCHAR(255),
    City VARCHAR(50),
    PhoneNumber VARCHAR(15)
);

create table Subjects (
    SubjectID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    SubjectName VARCHAR(50)
);


o Generate a report that will show all the students who have scored more than 60%

select s.FirstName,s.LastName,m.SubjectID,AVG(m.Mark) AS AverageMark
from Students s join SubjectMarks m ON s.StudentID = m.StudentID
GROUP BY s.FirstName,s.LastName,m.SubjectID
having AVG(m.Mark) > 60;

this query will return all students who have scored more than 60%.
